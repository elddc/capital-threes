In the event of\r\nnoncompliance, the State Board of Elections is directed to obtain compliance\r\nforthwith with this nondiscretionary duty of the election authority by\r\ninstituting legal proceedings in the circuit court of the county in which the\r\nelection authority maintains the registration information.  The costs of\r\nfurnishing updated copies of tapes or discs shall be paid at a rate of $.00034\r\nper name of registered voters in the election jurisdiction, but not less than\r\n$50 per tape or disc and shall be paid from appropriations made to the State\r\nBoard of Elections for reimbursement to the election authority for such\r\npurpose. The State Board shall furnish copies of such tapes, discs, other electronic\r\ndata or compilations thereof to state political committees registered pursuant\r\nto the Illinois Campaign Finance Act or the Federal Election Campaign Act and to governmental entities, at\r\ntheir request and at a reasonable cost.\r\nTo protect the privacy and confidentiality of voter registration information,\r\nthe disclosure\r\nof electronic voter registration records to any person or entity other than to a\r\nState or local political\r\ncommittee and other than to a governmental entity for a governmental\r\npurpose\r\nis specifically prohibited except as follows: subject to security measures adopted by the State Board of Elections which, at a minimum, shall include the keeping of a catalog or database, available for public view, including the name, address, and telephone number of the person viewing the list as well as the time of that viewing, any person may view the centralized statewide voter registration list on a computer screen at the Springfield office of the State Board of Elections, during normal business hours other than during the 27 days before an election, but the person viewing the list under this exception may not print, duplicate, transmit, or alter the list.\r\nCopies of the tapes, discs or other\r\nelectronic data shall be furnished by the county clerk to local political\r\ncommittees and governmental entities at their request and at a reasonable cost.  Reasonable cost of the\r\ntapes, discs, et cetera for this purpose would be the cost of duplication plus\r\n15% for administration.  The individual representing a political committee\r\nrequesting copies of such tapes shall make a sworn affidavit that the\r\ninformation shall be used only for bona fide political purposes,\r\nincluding by or for candidates for office or incumbent office holders.\r\nSuch tapes, discs or other electronic data shall not be used under any\r\ncircumstances by any political committee or individuals for purposes of\r\ncommercial solicitation or other business purposes.  If such tapes\r\ncontain information on county residents related to the operations of\r\ncounty government in addition to registration information, that\r\ninformation shall not be used under any circumstances for commercial\r\nsolicitation or other business purposes.  The prohibition in this\r\nSection against using the computer tapes or computer discs or other\r\nelectronic data processing information containing voter registration\r\ninformation for purposes of commercial solicitation or other business\r\npurposes shall be prospective only from the effective date of this\r\namended Act of 1979.

Each election authority utilizing\r\nelectronic data processing of voter registration information shall comply\r\nwith such regulations on and after May 15, 1988.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the applicant for registration was last registered in another\r\ncounty within this State, he shall also sign a certificate authorizing\r\ncancellation of the former registration. The certificate shall be in\r\nsubstantially the following form:\nTo the County Clerk of .... County, Illinois.

If an applicant\r\nfor registration declares upon properly witnessed oath, with his signature\r\nor mark affixed, that he cannot read the English language and that he will\r\nrequire assistance in voting, all his registration cards shall be marked in\r\na manner similar to the marking on the cards of a voter who requires\r\nassistance because of physical disability, except that the marking shall be\r\nof a different distinguishing color. Following each election the cards of\r\nany voter who has requested assistance as a voter with a disability, and has stated\r\nthat the disability is permanent, or who has received assistance because of\r\ninability to read the English language, shall be marked in the same manner.\n(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/5-7.02) (from Ch. 46, par. 5-7.02)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 5-7.02. \nUpon the issuance of a voter's identification card for persons with disabilities as provided\r\nin Section 19-12.1, the county clerk shall cause the identification number\r\nof such card to be clearly noted on all the registration cards of such voter.\n(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/5-7.03) (from Ch. 46, par. 5-7.03)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 5-7.03. \nThe State Board of Elections shall design a registration\r\nrecord card which, except as otherwise provided in this Section, shall\r\nbe used in triplicate by all election authorities\r\nin the State, except those election authorities adopting a computer-based\r\nvoter registration file authorized under Section 5-43.

If such voter is not\r\nin possession of or has lost his or her copy, he or she\r\nmay\r\neffect a transfer of registration by executing an Affidavit of Cancellation\r\nof Previous Registration. In the case of a transfer of registration to a\r\nnew election jurisdiction, the election authority shall transmit the\r\nvoter's copy or such affidavit to the election\r\nauthority of the\r\nvoter's former election jurisdiction, which shall immediately cause the\r\ntransmission of the voter's previous registration card to the voter's new\r\nelection authority.

During this grace period, an unregistered qualified\r\nelector may\r\nregister to vote, and a registered voter may submit a change of address form, in person in the office of the election\r\nauthority, at a permanent polling place established under Section 19A-10, at any other early voting site beginning 15 days prior to the election, at a polling place on election day, or at a voter registration location specifically designated for this\r\npurpose by the election authority. Grace period registration and changes of address shall also be conducted for eligible residents in connection with voting at facilities under Section 19-12.2 of this Code. The election authority shall\r\nregister that individual, or change a registered voter's address, in the same manner as otherwise provided by this Article for registration and change of address.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a voter who registers or changes address during this grace period wishes to vote at the election or primary occurring during the grace period, he or she must do so by grace period voting.

Ballots cast by persons who register or change address during the grace period at a location other than their designated polling place on election day must be transmitted to and counted at the election authority's central ballot counting location and shall not be transmitted to and counted at precinct polling places. The grace period ballots determined to be valid shall be added to the vote totals for the precincts for which they were cast in the order in which the ballots were opened.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In counties with a population of less than 100,000 that do not have electronic poll books, the election authority may opt out of registration  in the polling place if the election authority establishes grace period registration and voting at other sites on election day at the following sites: (i) the election authority's main office and (ii) a polling place in each municipality where 20% or more of the county's residents reside if the election authority's main office is not located in that municipality. The election authority may establish other grace period registration and voting sites on election day provided that the election authority has met the notice requirements of Section 19A-25 for permanent and temporary early voting sites.\n(Source: P.A. 100-442, eff. 8-25-17.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/5-105) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 5-105.

Audits ordered by the Board shall be conducted as provided in this Section and as provided by Board rule.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The Board may order a political committee to conduct an audit of its financial records for any of the following reasons: (i) a discrepancy between the ending balance of a reporting period and the beginning balance of the next reporting period, (ii) failure to account for previously reported investments or loans, or (iii) a discrepancy between reporting contributions received by or expenditures made for a political committee that are reported by another political committee, except the Board shall not order an audit pursuant to this item (iii) unless there is a willful pattern of inaccurate reporting or there is a pattern of similar inaccurate reporting involving similar contributions by the same contributor.  Prior to ordering an audit, the Board shall afford the political committee due notice and an opportunity for a closed preliminary hearing. A political committee shall hire an entity qualified to perform an audit; except, a political committee shall not hire a person that has contributed to the political committee during the previous 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) In each calendar year, the Board shall randomly select no more than 3% of registered political committees to conduct an audit.

A political committee selected to conduct an audit through the random selection process shall only be required to conduct the audit if it was required to file at least one quarterly report during the period to be covered by the audit and has: (i) a fund balance of $10,000 or more as of the close of the most recent reporting period; (ii) an average closing fund balance of $10,000 or more on quarterly reports occurring during the 2-year period to be covered by the audit; or (iii) average total receipts of $10,000 or more on quarterly reports occurring during the 2-year period to be covered by the audit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a political committee owing unpaid fines at the time of its random selection shall be ordered to conduct an audit. The Board shall not select additional registered political committees to conduct an audit to replace any of the originally selected political committees. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d) Upon receipt of notification from the Board ordering an audit, a political committee shall conduct an audit of the financial records required to be maintained by the committee to ensure compliance with the contribution limitations established in Section 9-8.5 and the reporting requirements established in Section 9-3 and Section 9-10 for a period of 2 years from the close of the most recent reporting period or the period since the committee was previously ordered to conduct an audit, whichever is shorter. The entity performing the audit shall review the amount of funds and investments maintained by the political committee and ensure the financial records accurately account for any contributions and expenditures made by the political committee.\r\n\r\nA certified copy of the audit shall be delivered to the Board within 60 calendar days after receipt of notice from the Board, unless the Board grants an extension to complete the audit.  A political committee ordered to conduct an audit through the random selection process shall not be required to conduct another audit for a minimum of 5 years unless the Board has reason to believe the political committee is in violation of Section 9-3, 9-8.5, or 9-10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)  The Board shall not disclose the name of any political committee ordered to conduct an audit or any documents in possession of the Board related to an audit unless, after review of the audit findings, the Board has reason to believe the political committee is in violation of Section 9-3, 9-8.5, or 9-10 and the Board imposed a fine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f) Failure to deliver a certified audit in a timely manner is a business offense punishable by a fine of $250 per day that the audit is late, up to a maximum of $5,000. \n(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/9-14) (from Ch. 46, par. 9-14)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 9-14. \n(Repealed). \n(Source: P.A. 90-737, eff. 1-1-99.

In order to situate each precinct within a\r\nsingle district or ward, the County Board shall change the boundaries of\r\nelection precincts after each decennial census as soon as is practicable\r\nfollowing the completion of congressional and legislative redistricting, except that, in 2021, the county board shall change the boundaries at a regular or special meeting within 60 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.\r\nIn determining whether a division of precincts should be\r\nmade, the county board may anticipate increased voter registration in\r\nany precinct in which there is in progress new construction of dwelling\r\nunits which will be occupied by voters more than 30 days before the next\r\nelection. Each district shall be composed of contiguous territory in as\r\ncompact form as can be for the convenience of the electors voting\r\ntherein.

The county\r\nboard of such county may divide or readjust precincts at any meeting of\r\nthe county board when the voter registration in a precinct has increased\r\nbeyond 1,800 registered voters and an election is scheduled before the next regular January\r\nor June meeting of the county board.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When in any city, village or incorporated town territory has been\r\nannexed thereto or disconnected therefrom, which annexation or\r\ndisconnection becomes effective after election precincts or election\r\ndistricts have been established as above provided in this Section, the\r\nclerk of the municipality shall inform the county clerk thereof as\r\nprovided in Section 4-21, 5-28.1, or 6-31.1, whichever is applicable. In\r\nthe event that a regular meeting of the County Board is to be held after\r\nsuch notification and before any election, the County Board shall, at\r\nits next regular meeting establish new election precinct lines in\r\naffected territory. In the event that no regular meeting of the County\r\nBoard is to be held before such election the county clerk shall, within\r\n5 days after being so informed, call a special meeting of the county\r\nboard on a day fixed by him not more than 20 days thereafter for the\r\npurpose of establishing election precincts or election districts in the\r\naffected territory for the ensuing elections.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At any consolidated primary or consolidated election at which\r\nmunicipal officers are to be elected, and at any emergency referendum at\r\nwhich a public question relating to a municipality is to be voted on,\r\nnotwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the election authority\r\nshall establish a polling place within such municipality, upon the request\r\nof the municipal council or board of trustees at least 60 days before the\r\nelection and provided that the municipality provides a suitable polling\r\nplace.

The number of such panels of judges required shall be\r\ndetermined by regulations of the State Board of Elections, which shall\r\nbase the required number of special panels on the number of registered\r\nvoters in the jurisdiction or the number of absentee ballots voted at\r\nrecent elections or any combination of such factors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No more than 3 persons of the same political party shall be appointed\r\njudges in the same election district or undivided precinct.

The respective\r\nCounty Central Committee chair shall notify the county board by June 1 of\r\neach odd-numbered year immediately preceding the annual meeting of the county\r\nboard whether or not such certified list will be filed by such chair. Such\r\nlist shall be arranged according to precincts.

However, he may, in his sole\r\ndiscretion, submit the names of persons who reside outside the precinct but\r\nwithin the county embracing the precinct in which they are to serve. He must,\r\nhowever, submit the names of at least 2 residents of the precinct for each\r\nprecinct in which his party is to have 3 judges and must submit the name of at\r\nleast one resident of the precinct for each precinct in which his party is to\r\nhave 2 judges.

The county board shall immediately give notice of such order and the\r\nnames of all such judges so reported to such court for confirmation and\r\ntheir residence and the precinct for which they were selected by causing\r\na notice to be published in one or more newspapers in the\r\ncounty and if no\r\nnewspaper be published therein then by posting such notice in 5 of the most\r\npublic places in the county.  The notice shall state that a list of judges of\r\nelection is available for public inspection in the office of the election\r\nauthority. If no cause to the contrary is shown prior\r\nto the day fixed, and if, in each precinct, at least one judge representing\r\neach of the two major political parties has been certified by the county\r\nclerk as having satisfactorily completed within the preceding 6 months the\r\ntraining course and examination for judges of election, as provided in\r\nSection 13-2.1 and 13-2.2 of this Act, such appointment shall be confirmed\r\nby order entered by that court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If in any precinct the requisite 2 judges have not been so certified by\r\nthe county clerk as having satisfactorily completed such course and\r\nexamination, the county clerk shall immediately notify all judges in that\r\nprecinct, to whose appointment there is no other objection, that all such\r\njudges shall attend the next such course. The county clerk shall then\r\ncertify to the court that all such judges have been so notified (and such\r\ncertification need contain no detail other than a mere recital). The\r\nappointment of such judges shall then be confirmed by order entered by the\r\ncourt. If any judge so notified and so confirmed fails to attend the next\r\nsuch course, such failure shall subject such judge to possible removal from\r\noffice at the option of the election authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If objections to the appointment of any judge be filed prior to the day\r\nfixed by the court for confirmation of judges, the court shall hear such\r\nobjections and the evidence introduced in support thereof, and shall\r\nconfirm or refuse to confirm such nominations as the interests of the\r\npublic may require. No reasons may be given for the refusal to confirm. If\r\nany vacancy exists at any time the county board shall, subject to the\r\nprovisions of Section 13-1.1, further report and nominate persons to fill\r\nsuch vacancies so existing in the manner aforesaid, and a court in the same\r\nway shall consider such nominations and shall confirm or refuse to confirm\r\nthe same in the manner aforesaid. Upon the confirmation of such judges, at\r\nany time, a commission shall issue to each of such judges, under the seal\r\nof such court, and appropriate forms shall be prepared by the county clerk\r\nof each county for such purpose and furnished to the county board, and\r\nafter confirmation and acceptance of such commission, such judges shall\r\nthereupon become officers of such court. If a vacancy occurs so late that\r\nnomination by the county board and application to and confirmation by the\r\ncourt cannot be had before the election, then the court shall, subject to\r\nthe provisions of Section 13-1.1, make an appointment and issue a\r\ncommission to such officer or officers, and when thus appointed such\r\nofficer shall be considered an officer of the court and subject to the same\r\nrules as if nominated by the county board and confirmed by the court, and\r\nany judge, however appointed, and at whatever time, shall be considered an\r\nofficer of court and be subject to the same control and punishment in case\r\nof misbehavior. Not more than 10 business days after the day of election,\r\nthe county clerk shall compile a list\r\ncontaining the name, address and party affiliation of each judge of\r\nelection who served on the day of election, and\r\nshall preserve such list and make it available for public inspection\r\nand copying for a period of not more than one year from the date of receipt\r\nof such list.  Copies of such list shall be available for purchase at a\r\ncost not to exceed the cost of duplication.\r\nThe board has the right, at any time, in case of\r\nmisbehavior or neglect of duty, to remove any judge of election and cause\r\nsuch vacancy to be filled in accordance with this Act. Except for judges\r\nappointed under subsection (b) of Section 13-4, the board shall have\r\nthe right, at any time, to remove any judge of election for failing to vote\r\nthe primary ballot of the political party he represents, at a primary\r\nelection at which he served as such judge, and shall cause such vacancy to\r\nbe filled in accordance with this Act.\r\nThe board shall remove any judge of election who, twice during the same\r\nterm of office, fails to provide for the opening of the polling place at\r\nthe time prescribed in Section 17-1 or Section 18-2, whichever is\r\napplicable, unless such delay can be demonstrated\r\nby the judge of election to be beyond his or her control.\r\nIn the event that any judge of\r\nelection is removed for cause, the board shall specify such cause in\r\nwriting and make such writing a matter of public record, with a copy to be\r\nsent to the appropriate county chair who made the initial recommendation\r\nof the election judge. If any vacancies occur or exist more than 15 days\r\nbefore election the judges appointed to such places must be confirmed by\r\nsuch court. The county board shall not voluntarily remove any judge within\r\n15 days of such election except for flagrant misbehavior, incapacity or\r\ndishonesty, and the reason therefor must afterward be reported in writing\r\nto such court and made a matter of public record, with a copy to be sent to\r\nthe appropriate county chair who made the initial recommendation of the\r\nelection judge. Provided further that where a vacancy in the office of\r\njudge of election exists 20 days or less prior to any election in counties\r\nhaving a population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, or where such vacancy\r\nexists 10 days or less prior to any election in counties having less than\r\n3,000,000 inhabitants, the county clerk shall, subject to the provisions of\r\nSection 13-1.1, appoint a person of the same major political party to fill\r\nsuch vacancy and issue a commission thereto. The name of the officer so\r\nappointed shall be reported to the court as a matter of record and after\r\nacceptance of such commission such person shall be liable in the same\r\nmanner as officers regularly appointed by the county board and confirmed by\r\nthe court. The county clerk shall have the power on election day to remove\r\nwithout cause any judge of election appointed by the other judges of\r\nelection pursuant to Section 13-7 and to appoint another judge of election\r\nto serve for that election. Such substitute judge of election must be\r\nselected, where possible, pursuant to the provisions of Section 13-1.1 and\r\nmust be qualified in accordance with Section 13-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any precinct has increased in voter registration beyond the maximum\r\nof 800 provided in Section 11-2, the county clerk may appoint one\r\nadditional judge of election from each political party for each 200 voters\r\nin excess of 800.\n(Source: P.A. 100-1027, eff. 1-1-19.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/13-4) (from Ch. 46, par. 13-4)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 13-4.

Whereupon the vote of such person shall be received, and entered as other\r\nvotes. But such judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in\r\ntheir respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, so\r\ndelivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to the office of\r\nthe commissioners of election.

A voter whose ballot is not accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the ballot, request and vote another ballot.  The voter's surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing that voting equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver to one of\r\nthe judges of election all of the ballots, properly folded, which he\r\nreceived.

If a voter delivers less than all of the ballots\r\ngiven to him, the judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in\r\na voice clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter\r\nmust return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the judge to\r\nthe voter shall clearly express the fact that the voter is not required\r\nto vote such remaining ballots but that whether or not he votes them he\r\nmust fold and deliver them to the judge. In making such statement the\r\njudge of election shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of\r\nvoice that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular\r\nmanner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting booth of a\r\nvoter who has failed to deliver the total number of ballots received by\r\nhim until such voter has returned to the voting booth pursuant to the\r\njudge's request and again quit the booth with all of the ballots\r\nrequired to be returned by him.

It shall\r\nbe the privilege of such party and organization representatives to be\r\npresent at the preparation of the voting machines for the election and\r\nto see that each machine is tested for accuracy and is properly prepared\r\nand that all registering counters are set at zero. The custodian shall,\r\nin the presence of the party and candidate and organization\r\nrepresentatives, prepare the voting machine for the election and set all\r\nregistering counters at zero, and he shall then, assisted by the\r\nwatchers, test each such registering counter for accuracy by casting\r\nvotes upon it, and such testing shall be done in the presence of the\r\nwatchers, until each such registering counter is correctly registering\r\neach vote cast upon it, and each certificate for each machine shall\r\nstate that this has been done, and the custodians shall then, in the\r\npresence of the party and candidate and organization representatives,\r\nreset each registering counter to zero, and shall then immediately seal\r\nthe voting machine with a numbered metal seal, and a record of the\r\nnumber on the seal shall then and there be made by the custodian on the\r\ncertificate for that machine and the seal shall be so placed as to\r\nprevent operation of the machine or its registering counters without\r\nbreaking the seal, and the custodian shall then immediately make a\r\nrecord on the certificate for that machine of the reading shown on the\r\nprotective counter. Immediately after each machine has been so tested\r\nand prepared for the election, it shall be the duty of such custodian or\r\ncustodians to make a certificate in writing which shall be filed in the\r\noffice of the election authority, stating the serial\r\nnumber of each voting\r\nmachine, whether or not such machine has all the registering counters\r\nset at zero, whether or not such machine has been tested by voting on\r\neach registering counter so as to prove that each such registering\r\ncounter is in perfect and accurate working condition, the number\r\nregistered on the protective counter, and the number on the metal seal\r\nwith which the machine is sealed against operation.

They shall also see that the voting\r\nmachine is properly illuminated in accordance with the equipment\r\nfurnished. The precinct election officials shall compare the ballot\r\nlabels on the machine with the sample ballots and return sheets, see\r\nthat they are correct, examine and see that all the registering counters\r\nin the machine are set at zero (0) or if the machine is equipped with a\r\ndevice which will automatically record the number on the registering\r\ncolumns on the back of the machine to recording sheets of paper and the\r\nsaid paper can be removed without opening the back of the machine, that\r\nall of the said registering counters for each candidate as appears on\r\nthe said recording sheet registers (0) and that the public counter is\r\nalso set at zero (0) and that the machine is otherwise in perfect order\r\nand they shall compare and record the number on the metal seal with\r\nwhich the voting machine is sealed, with the number furnished them as\r\nrecorded on the envelope containing the keys, by the election authority,\r\nand if the number on the seal and the number on the protective\r\ncounter do not agree with the numbers supplied to them, they shall not\r\nopen the polls, but shall notify the election authority, and the election\r\nauthority or its authorized representatives or\r\ncustodian, shall, as soon as may be, test, examine and set the machine\r\nin the same manner as is provided in this section for the testing,\r\nsetting and preparation of voting machines for an election. If, after\r\nbeing so tested and examined, it is found that such voting machine is in\r\nperfect working order, all registering counters shall be set at zero\r\n(0), the reading of the protective counter shall be read and recorded\r\nand the precinct election officials may proceed with the opening of the\r\npolls. If such machine be found not to be in perfect working order as\r\nhereinbefore provided, it shall not be used in the election, but shall\r\nbe replaced with another machine which is in perfect working order,\r\nproperly set, tested and sealed, and the election board shall then\r\nproceed to examine such machine in the same manner as is provided in\r\nthis section for the examination of each voting machine by the election\r\nboard before the opening of the polls. They shall not thereafter permit\r\nthe counters to be operated or moved except by electors in voting, and\r\nthey shall also see that all necessary arrangements and adjustments are\r\nmade for voting irregular ballots on the machine.

Two precinct election\r\nofficials, not members of the same political party, shall write the\r\ntotals in figures, in ink, for such candidate on the duplicate return\r\nsheets provided for that purpose, while one election officer announces\r\nin a distinct voice the total vote cast for each candidate thus\r\nascertained in the order of the offices as their titles are arranged on\r\nthe ballot label, and the remaining precinct election official or\r\nofficials, if any, shall be stationed at the counter compartment of the\r\nvoting machine being canvassed and shall watch each total as it is being\r\ncalled out from the registering counters. Each precinct election\r\nofficial who is recording the totals on the return sheets shall\r\ndistinctly repeat each total as it is announced from the counter of the\r\nvoting machine. The totals of each machine for each candidate shall be\r\nrecorded on the return sheets in such a manner that they may be\r\nidentified by the serial number of the voting machine. The vote both for\r\nand against each question or other proposition shall also be announced\r\nand recorded in the same manner as the vote for the candidates. When the\r\nmachine is equipped with a device which will automatically record the\r\nregistering column on the back of the machine to recording sheets of\r\npaper giving the accurate vote cast for each candidate then the totals\r\ncast for each candidate or each question or proposition shall be called\r\nout the same as if they were being read from the Counter Compartment of\r\nthe voting machine, provided however the paper recording sheet shall\r\nconstitute the return sheet for the precinct or consolidated area and no\r\nreturn sheets shall be required. When more than one voting machine is\r\nused in the same election precinct, the canvass of the first machine\r\nshall be completed before the second and so on. When the canvass of all\r\ntotals shall have been completed, the precinct election board shall\r\ncanvass all vote by mail ballots in the same manner provided by law for\r\ncanvassing paper ballots. The totals of the vote by mail votes for each\r\ncandidate and for each question or other proposition shall be recorded\r\non the return sheets under the totals from the voting machines and the\r\nfinal total of the votes received by each candidate, and each\r\nconstitutional amendment, question or other proposition, shall be\r\nascertained and recorded in the space provided for that purpose on the\r\nreturn sheets. Upon the completion of the canvass as hereinbefore\r\nprovided, one of the precinct election officials shall, in a loud and\r\ndistinct voice announce the total votes received by each candidate, and\r\nthe total votes cast both for and against each constitutional amendment,\r\nquestion or other proposition, and such proclamation shall be made\r\nslowly enough so as to enable anyone desiring to do so, to record each\r\nsuch result as it is announced. Except where a voting machine is\r\nequipped with an automatic recording sheet when the proclamation is\r\ncompleted, the election official who announced the totals from the\r\ncounters of the machine or machines, shall take his place at one of the\r\nreturn sheets and one of the election officials of the opposite party\r\nwho has completed the recording of the returns on the return sheets\r\nshall take his place at the counter compartment of the voting machine\r\nfirst canvassed, and he shall then proceed to announce each total on\r\neach registering counter in the same manner as it was done for the first\r\ncanvass. Before the recheck of the voting machine is begun, the two\r\nprecinct election officials who are to recheck the totals on the return\r\nsheets shall exchange return sheets and each election official shall\r\nthen, as the canvass proceeds, check each total as it is announced from\r\nthe registering counters of the voting machine or machines for the\r\nsecond time. As each total is announced each precinct election official\r\nwho is checking the totals on the return sheets shall repeat in a loud\r\nand distinct voice each total as it is announced. If any errors in the\r\noriginal canvass are discovered they shall be corrected at once in the\r\npresence of all the precinct election officials and a certificate shall\r\nbe prepared and signed by each such election official, setting forth\r\nwhich errors were discovered and what corrections were made, and such\r\ncertificate shall be made in duplicate and one filed with each return\r\nsheet. During the process of rechecking each total on the machines, the\r\nprecinct election official or officials, if any, who at the original\r\ncanvass acted as watcher or watchers at the registering counters of the\r\nmachines, shall in the same manner verify the accuracy of each total as\r\nit is announced from the machine or machines and is repeated by the two\r\nprecinct election officials who are rechecking the totals as written on\r\nthe return sheets. When this recheck is completed the entire precinct\r\nelection board shall take one of the return sheets and fold it in\r\naccordion pleats approximately ten inches wide with the face of the\r\nreturn sheet out, in such a manner that each pleat can easily be turned\r\nas the final recheck proceeds. The entire precinct election board shall\r\nthen begin at the voting machine first canvassed and each such election\r\nofficial shall, simultaneously with the other such election officials,\r\nand in the presence of each other, examine each registering counter on\r\nthe voting machine, and immediately examine the corresponding record for\r\nthat counter, as it is written on the return sheet, and shall satisfy\r\nhimself that both numbers are the same. Each total on each voting\r\nmachine shall be as examined and when such examination has been\r\ncompleted, the entire precinct election board shall then compare each\r\ntotal on such return sheet with the corresponding total on the duplicate\r\nreturn sheet and each precinct election official shall satisfy himself\r\nthat all totals are the same on both return sheets. Each precinct\r\nelection official shall sign a certificate stating that each step in the\r\ncanvass of the voting machines, as provided herein, has been carefully\r\nand faithfully carried out in every detail. If any errors are discovered\r\nduring the final recheck of the registering counters and comparison of\r\nthe duplicate return sheets, such errors shall be corrected at once, and\r\neach precinct election official shall sign a certificate stating which\r\nerrors were found and what corrections were made and such corrections\r\nshall be made in the presence of all the precinct election officials.\r\nThe precinct election board shall then canvass the irregular ballot in\r\nsubstantially the same manner as the law provides for canvassing the\r\nreturns for paper ballots, and shall record the results thereof on the\r\nreturn sheets in the space provided for that purpose. Before leaving the\r\nroom and before closing and locking the counting compartment, each\r\nprecinct election official shall make and sign the certificate and\r\nwritten statements and the return sheets of such election as provided by\r\nlaw. In precincts where the voting machines are equipped with the\r\nautomatic recording sheet and two or more machines the total vote cast\r\nfor each candidate, question or proposition from each machine shall be\r\nrecorded separately on the statement of votes as provided for in Section\r\n18-14, and the grand total of all votes appearing on the recording\r\nsheets shall be recorded on the statement of votes and proclaimed by the\r\njudges in the same manner as is herein provided for proclamation of\r\nvotes from the return sheets. All vote by mail ballots and irregular ballots\r\nof each voting machine shall be returned to the proper officer together\r\nwith the return sheets and certificates and supplies and such vote by mail \r\nballots and irregular machine ballots shall be preserved and finally\r\ndestroyed as is now provided by law when paper ballots are used. The\r\nwritten statements or returns so made, after having been properly\r\nsigned, shall be distinctly and clearly read in the hearing of all\r\npersons present in the polling place, and ample opportunity shall be\r\ngiven to compare the results so certified with the counter dials of the\r\nmachine. After such comparison and correction, if any is made, the\r\nprecinct election officials shall then close the counting compartment\r\nand lock the same. Thereafter the voting machine shall remain locked and\r\nsealed against voting for a period of at least 30 days, after the\r\nresults of the election have been declared, unless otherwise ordered by\r\nthe circuit court: provided, however, upon application to the circuit\r\ncourt, the circuit judge may order the said machines opened prior to the\r\nthirty day period herein required to be closed. The circuit court in its\r\norder shall specify the manner in which the count recorded on the\r\nmachines shall be taken and preserved: provided, however, when the\r\nmachines are equipped with any recording or photographic device on which\r\nvotes registered on the mechanical counters will be separately recorded\r\nor photographed, as provided in Section 24-18 hereof, and it is\r\nnecessary to use said machines at an election occurring within said 30\r\ndays, then after the machines have remained locked for a period of 48\r\nhours they may be prepared for such subsequent election as herein\r\nprovided. Whenever it is necessary to reset the machines for another\r\nelection prior to the time limit for the filing of election contests, it\r\nshall be the duty of the proper officials to make a photographic record\r\nof the machines involved to be used in case of an election contest,\r\nwhereupon the machines may be set back to zero and arranged for the next\r\nelection.\n(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24-17) (from Ch. 46, par. 24-17)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24-17. \n\nAll of the keys of the machine or machines other than those\r\nautomatically sealed in the machine, shall be placed in the envelopes\r\nprovided for that purpose, and the envelopes shall be sealed and the\r\nenvelopes shall designate the serial number of the voting machine to which\r\nsuch keys belong, and the number of the precinct and ward in which such\r\nvoting machine was used at such election, and such keys shall be returned\r\nalong with the written statements or returns of such election.\n(Source: Laws 1943, vol. 2, p. 1.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24-18) (from Ch. 46, par. 24-18)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24-18. \n\nA voting machine which passes all of the qualities\r\nrequired by this Article may be supplied, in addition, with any\r\nrecording or photographic device on which the votes registered on the\r\nmechanical counters will be separately recorded or photographed.

Thereupon\r\ntwo of the judges of election, of different political parties, shall\r\nforthwith and by the most direct route transport both ballot boxes to\r\nthe counting location designated by the county clerk or board of\r\nelection commissioners.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the ballots of a precinct are fed to the electronic tabulating\r\nequipment, the first ballot box shall be opened at the central counting\r\nstation by the two precinct transport judges. Upon opening a ballot box,\r\nsuch team shall first count the number of ballots in the box. If 2 or\r\nmore  are folded together so as to appear to have been cast by the same\r\nperson, all of the ballots so folded together shall be marked and\r\nreturned with the other ballots in the same condition, as near as may\r\nbe, in which they were found when first opened, but shall not be\r\ncounted. If the remaining ballots are found to exceed the number of\r\npersons voting in the precinct as shown by the slip signed by the judges\r\nof election, the ballots shall be replaced in the box, and the box\r\nclosed and well shaken and again opened and one of the precinct\r\ntransport judges shall publicly draw out so many ballots unopened as are\r\nequal to such excess.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such excess ballots shall be marked \"Excess-Not Counted\" and signed\r\nby the two precinct transport judges and shall be placed in the \"After\r\n7:00 p.m. Defective Ballots Envelope\".  The number of excess ballots\r\nshall be noted in the remarks section of the Certificate of Results.\r\n\"Excess\" ballots shall not be counted in the total of  \"defective\"\r\nballots.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The precinct transport judges shall then examine the remaining\r\nballots for write-in votes and shall count and tabulate the write-in\r\nvote; or\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) A single ballot box, for the deposit of all votes cast, shall be\r\nused. All ballots which are not to be tabulated on the electronic voting\r\nsystem shall be counted, tallied, and returned as elsewhere provided in this Code\r\n for the counting and handling of paper\r\nballots.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All ballots to be processed and tabulated with the electronic voting\r\nsystem shall be processed as follows:\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after the closing of the polls, the precinct judges of\r\nelection then shall open the ballot box and canvass the votes polled to\r\ndetermine that the number of ballots therein agree with the number of\r\nvoters voting as shown by the applications for ballot or if the same do\r\nnot agree the judges of election shall make such ballots agree with the\r\napplications for ballot in the manner provided by Section 17-18 of this Code. The judges of election shall then examine all ballot cards and ballot card envelopes which\r\nare in\r\nthe ballot box to determine whether the\r\nballot cards and\r\nballot card envelopes bear the initials of a precinct judge of election.\r\nIf any ballot card or ballot card envelope is not\r\ninitialed, it shall be marked on the back \"Defective,\" initialed as to\r\nsuch label by all judges immediately under such word \"Defective,\" and\r\nnot counted, but placed in the envelope provided for that purpose\r\nlabeled \"Defective Ballots Envelope.\"\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When an electronic voting system is used which utilizes a ballot\r\ncard, before separating the ballot cards from their respective\r\ncovering envelopes, the judges of election shall examine the ballot card\r\nenvelopes for write-in votes. When the voter has voted a write-in vote,\r\nthe judges of election shall compare the write-in vote with the votes on\r\nthe ballot card to determine whether such write-in results in an\r\novervote for any office. In case of an overvote for any office, the\r\njudges of election, consisting in each case of at least one judge of\r\nelection of each of the two major political parties, shall make a true\r\nduplicate ballot of all votes on such ballot card except for the office\r\nwhich is overvoted, by using the ballot label booklet of the precinct\r\nand one of the marking devices of the precinct so as to transfer all\r\nvotes of the voter except for the office overvoted, to an official\r\nballot card of that kind used in the precinct at that election. The\r\noriginal ballot card and envelope upon which there is an overvote shall\r\nbe clearly labeled \"Overvoted Ballot\", and each shall bear the same\r\nserial number which shall be placed thereon by the judges of election,\r\ncommencing with number 1 and continuing consecutively for the ballots of\r\nthat kind in that precinct. The judges of election shall initial the\r\n\"Duplicate Overvoted Ballot\" ballot cards and shall place them in the\r\nbox for return of the ballots. The \"Overvoted Ballot\" ballots and their\r\nenvelopes shall be placed in the \"Duplicate Ballots\" envelope. Envelopes\r\nbearing write-in votes marked in the place designated therefor and\r\nbearing the initials of a precinct judge of election and not resulting\r\nin an overvote and otherwise complying with the election laws as to\r\nmarking shall be counted, tallied, and their votes recorded on a tally\r\nsheet provided by the election official in charge of the election. The\r\nballot cards and ballot card envelopes shall be separated and all except\r\nany defective or overvoted shall be placed separately in the box for\r\nreturn of the ballots. The judges of election shall examine the\r\nballots and ballot cards to determine if any is damaged, defective, or cannot otherwise be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment. If any\r\nballot or ballot card is damaged, defective, or cannot otherwise properly\r\nbe counted by the automatic tabulating equipment, the judges of\r\nelection, consisting in each case of at least one judge of election of\r\neach of the two major political parties, shall make a true duplicate\r\nballot of all votes on such ballot card by using the ballot label\r\nbooklet of the precinct and one of the marking devices of the precinct.\r\nThe original ballot or ballot card and envelope shall be clearly labeled\r\n\"Damaged Ballot\" and the ballot or ballot card so produced \"Duplicate\r\nDamaged Ballot,\" and each shall bear the same number which shall be\r\nplaced thereon by the judges of election, commencing with number 1 and\r\ncontinuing consecutively for the ballots of that kind in the precinct.\r\nThe judges of election shall initial the \"Duplicate Damaged Ballot\"\r\nballot or ballot cards, and shall place them in the box for return of\r\nthe ballots. The \"Damaged Ballot\" ballots or ballot cards and their\r\nenvelopes shall be placed in the \"Duplicated Ballots\" envelope. A slip\r\nindicating the number of voters voting in person shall be made out, signed by all\r\njudges of election, and inserted in the box for return of the ballots.\r\nThe tally sheets recording the write-in votes shall be placed in this\r\nbox. The judges of election thereupon immediately shall securely lock the\r\nballot box or other suitable\r\nbox furnished for return of the ballots by the election official in\r\ncharge of the election; provided that if such box is not of a type which\r\nmay be securely locked, such box shall be sealed with filament tape provided\r\nfor such purpose which shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise and crosswise,\r\nat least twice each way.  A separate adhesive seal label signed by each of\r\nthe judges of election of the precinct shall be affixed to the box so as\r\nto cover any slot therein and to identify the box of the precinct; and\r\nif such box is sealed with filament tape as provided herein rather than\r\nlocked, such tape shall be wrapped around the box as provided herein, but\r\nin such manner that the separate adhesive seal label affixed to the box\r\nand signed by the judges may not be removed without breaking the filament\r\ntape and disturbing the signature of the judges.  Thereupon, 2 of the\r\njudges of election, of different major political parties, forthwith shall\r\nby the most direct route transport the box for\r\nreturn of the ballots and enclosed ballots and returns to the central\r\ncounting location designated by the election official in charge of the\r\nelection. If, however, because of the lack of adequate parking\r\nfacilities at the central counting location or for any other reason, it\r\nis impossible or impracticable for the boxes from all the polling places\r\nto be delivered directly to the central counting location, the election\r\nofficial in charge of the election may designate some other location to\r\nwhich the boxes shall be delivered by the 2 precinct judges.

As soon as possible, the boxes shall be transported\r\nfrom such other location to the central counting location by one or more\r\nteams, each consisting of 4 persons, 2 from each of the 2 major\r\npolitical parties, designated for such purpose by the election official\r\nin charge of elections from recommendations by the appropriate political\r\nparty organizations.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"Defective Ballots\" envelope, and \"Duplicated Ballots\" envelope\r\neach shall be securely sealed and the flap or end thereof of each signed\r\nby the precinct judges of election and returned to the central counting\r\nlocation with the box for return of the ballots, enclosed ballots and\r\nreturns.\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the central counting location, a team of tally judges designated\r\nby the election official in charge of the election shall check the box\r\nreturned containing the ballots to determine that all seals are intact,\r\nand thereupon shall open the box, check the voters' slip and compare the\r\nnumber of ballots so delivered against the total number of voters of the\r\nprecinct who voted, remove the ballots or ballot cards and deliver them\r\nto the technicians operating the automatic tabulating equipment.  Any\r\ndiscrepancies between the number of ballots and total number of voters\r\nshall be noted on a sheet furnished for that purpose and signed by the\r\ntally judges; or\r\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) A single ballot box, for the deposit of all votes cast, shall be used.\r\nImmediately after the closing of the polls, the precinct judges of election shall\r\nsecurely\r\nlock the ballot box; provided that if such box is not of a\r\ntype which may be securely locked, such box shall be sealed with filament\r\ntape provided for such purpose which shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise\r\nand crosswise, at least twice each way.\r\nA separate adhesive seal label signed by each of the judges of election\r\nof the precinct shall be affixed to the box so as to cover any slot therein\r\nand to identify the box of the precinct; and if such box is sealed with\r\nfilament tape as provided herein rather than locked, such tape shall be\r\nwrapped around the box as provided herein, but in such manner that the separate\r\nadhesive seal label affixed to the box and signed by the judges may not\r\nbe removed without breaking the filament tape and disturbing the signature\r\nof the judges.  Thereupon, 2 of the judges\r\nof election, of different\r\nmajor political parties, shall forthwith by the most direct route transport\r\nthe box for return of the ballots and enclosed vote by mail and early ballots\r\nand returns\r\nto the central counting location designated by the election official\r\nin charge of the election.  If however, because of the lack of adequate\r\nparking facilities at the central counting location or for some other reason,\r\nit is impossible or impracticable for the boxes from all the polling places\r\nto be delivered directly to the central counting location, the election\r\nofficial in charge of the election may designate some other location to\r\nwhich the boxes shall be delivered by the 2 precinct judges.

Each team shall consist of 5 tally judges, 3 selected\r\nand approved by the county board from a certified list furnished by the chair\r\n of the county central committee of the party with the majority\r\nof members on the county board and 2 selected and approved by the county\r\nboard from a certified list furnished by the chair of the county central\r\ncommittee of the party with the second largest number of members\r\non the county board.  At the central counting location a team of tally judges\r\nshall open the ballot box and canvass the votes polled to determine that\r\nthe number of ballot sheets\r\ntherein agree with the number of voters voting as shown by the applications\r\nfor ballot; and, if the same do not agree, the tally judges shall make such\r\nballots agree with the number of applications for ballot in the manner provided\r\nby Section 17-18 of this Code.  The tally judges shall then examine\r\nall ballot sheets which are in the ballot box to determine whether they\r\nbear the initials of the precinct judge of election.

The vendor, person, or other private entity shall be solely responsible for the production and cost of:  all ballots; additional temporary workers; and other equipment or facilities needed and used in the testing of the vendor's, person's, or other private entity's  respective equipment and software.  After an\r\nerrorless test, materials used in the public test, including the\r\nprogram, if appropriate, shall be sealed and remain sealed  until the\r\ntest is run again on election day.  If any error is detected, the\r\ncause of the error shall be determined and corrected, and an\r\nerrorless public test shall be made before the automatic\r\ntabulating equipment is approved.  Each election authority shall\r\nfile a sealed copy of each tested program to be used within its\r\njurisdiction at an election with the State Board of Elections\r\nbefore the election.  The Board shall secure the program or\r\nprograms of each election jurisdiction so filed in its office until the next election of the same type (general primary, general election, consolidated primary, or consolidated election) for which the program or programs were filed.  At the expiration of that time, if no election\r\ncontest or appeal is pending in an election\r\njurisdiction, the Board shall destroy the sealed program or\r\nprograms.  Except\r\nwhere in-precinct counting equipment is used, the test shall\r\nbe repeated immediately before the start of the official counting\r\nof the ballots, in the same manner as set forth above.  After the\r\ncompletion of the count, the test shall be re-run using the same\r\nprogram.  Immediately after the re-run, all material\r\nused in testing the program and the programs shall be sealed\r\nand retained under the custody of the election authority for a\r\nperiod of 60 days.  At the expiration of that time the election\r\nauthority shall destroy the voted ballots, together with all\r\nunused ballots returned from the precincts.  Provided, if any\r\ncontest of election is pending at the time in which the ballots\r\nmay be required as evidence and the election authority has\r\nnotice of the contest, the same shall not be destroyed until after the\r\ncontest is finally determined.

The first ballot box is for the depositing of votes cast on the electronic voting system; and the second ballot box is for all votes cast on other ballots, including any paper ballots required to be voted other than on the Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology electronic voting system.  Ballots deposited in the second ballot box shall be counted, tallied, and returned as is elsewhere provided in this Code for the counting and handling of paper ballots.  Immediately after the closing of the polls, the judges of election shall make out a slip indicating the number of persons who voted in the precinct at the election.  The slip shall be signed by all the judges of election and shall be inserted by them in the first ballot box. The judges of election shall thereupon immediately lock each  ballot box; provided, that if the box is not of a type which may be securely locked, the box shall be sealed with filament tape provided for the purpose that shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise and crosswise, at least twice each way, and in a manner that the seal completely covers the slot in the ballot box, and each of the judges shall sign the seal.  Two of the judges of election, of different political parties, shall by the most direct route transport both ballot boxes to the counting location designated by the county clerk or board of election commissioners.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the ballots of a precinct are fed to the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0electronic Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology tabulating equipment, the first ballot box shall be opened at the central counting station by the 2 precinct transport judges.  Upon opening a ballot box, the team shall first count the number of ballots in the box.  If 2 or more are folded together to appear to have been cast by the same person, all of the ballots folded together shall be marked and returned with the other ballots in the same condition, as near as may be, in which they were found when first opened, but shall not be counted.  If the remaining ballots are found to exceed the number of persons voting in the precinct as shown by the slip signed by the judges of election, the ballots shall be replaced in the box, and the box closed and well shaken and again opened and one of the precinct transport judges shall publicly draw out so many ballots unopened as are equal to the excess.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The excess ballots shall be marked \"Excess-Not \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Counted\" and signed by the 2 precinct transport judges and shall be placed in the \"After 7:00 p.m. Defective Ballots Envelope\".

The original ballot upon which there is an overvote shall be clearly labeled \"Overvoted Ballot\", and each shall bear the same serial number which shall be placed thereon by the judges of election, beginning with number 1 and continuing consecutively for the ballots of that kind in that precinct.  The judges of election shall initial the \"Duplicate Overvoted Ballot\" ballots and shall place them in the box for return of the ballots.  The \"Overvoted Ballot\" ballots shall be placed in the \"Duplicate Ballots\" envelope.  The ballots except any defective or overvoted ballot shall be placed separately in the box for return of the ballots.  The judges of election shall examine the ballots to determine if any is damaged, defective, or cannot otherwise be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment.  If any ballot is damaged, defective, or cannot otherwise properly be counted by the automatic tabulating equipment, the judges of election, consisting in each case of at least one judge of election of each of the 2 major political parties, shall make a true duplicate ballot of all votes on such ballot by using the ballot of the precinct and one of the marking devices, or equivalent ballot, of the precinct.  The original ballot and ballot envelope shall be clearly labeled \"Damaged Ballot\" and the ballot so produced \"Duplicate Damaged Ballot\", and each shall bear the same number which shall be placed thereon by the judges of election, commencing with number 1 and continuing consecutively for the ballots of that kind in the precinct.  The judges of election shall initial the \"Duplicate Damaged Ballot\" ballot  and shall place them in the box for return of the ballots. The \"Damaged Ballot\" ballots shall be placed in the \"Duplicated Ballots\" envelope.  A slip indicating the number of voters voting in person and the total number of voters of the precinct who voted at the election shall be made out, signed by all judges of election, and inserted in the box for return of the ballots.  The tally sheets recording the write-in votes shall be placed in this box.  The judges of election immediately shall securely lock the ballot box or other suitable box furnished for return of the ballots by the election official in charge of the election; provided that if the box is not of a type which may be securely locked, the box shall be sealed with filament tape provided for the purpose which shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise and crosswise, at least twice each way.  A separate adhesive seal label signed by each of the judges of election of the precinct shall be affixed to the box to cover any slot therein and to identify the box of the precinct; and if the box is sealed with filament tape as provided rather than locked, such tape shall be wrapped around the box as provided, but in such manner that the separate adhesive seal label affixed to the box and signed by the judges may not be removed without breaking the filament tape and disturbing the signature of the judges.  Two of the judges of election, of different major political parties, shall by the most direct route transport the box for return of the ballots and enclosed ballots and returns to the central counting location designated by the election official in charge of the election.  If, however, because of the lack of adequate parking facilities at the central counting location or for any other reason, it is impossible or impracticable for the boxes from all the polling places to be delivered directly to the central counting location, the election official in charge of the election may designate some other location to which the boxes shall be delivered by the 2 precinct judges.  While at the other location the boxes shall be in the care and custody of one or more teams, each consisting of 4 persons, 2 from each of the 2 major political parties, designated for such purpose by the election official in charge of elections from recommendations by the appropriate political party organizations.  As soon as possible, the boxes shall be transported from the other location to the central counting location by one or more teams, each consisting of 4 persons, 2 from each of the 2 major political parties, designated for the purpose by the election official in charge of elections from recommendations by the appropriate political party organizations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"Defective Ballots\" envelope, and \"Duplicated \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ballots\" envelope each shall be securely sealed and the flap or end of each envelope signed by the precinct judges of election and returned to the central counting location with the box for return of the ballots, enclosed ballots and returns.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the central counting location, a team of tally \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0judges designated by the election official in charge of the election shall check the box returned containing the ballots to determine that all seals are intact, and shall open the box, check the voters' slip and compare the number of ballots so delivered against the total number of voters of the precinct who voted, remove the ballots and deliver them to the technicians operating the automatic tabulating equipment.  Any discrepancies between the number of ballots and total number of voters shall be noted on a sheet furnished for that purpose and signed by the tally judges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) A single ballot box, for the deposit of all votes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cast, shall be used.

At the central counting location  a team of tally judges shall open the ballot box and canvass the votes polled to determine that the number of ballot sheets therein agree with the number of voters voting as shown by the applications for ballot and, if the same do not agree, the tally judges shall make such ballots agree with the number of applications for ballot in the manner provided by Section 17-18 of this Code.  The tally judges shall then examine all ballot sheets that are in the ballot box to determine whether they bear the initials of the precinct judge of election.  If any ballot is not initialed, it shall be marked on the back \"Defective\", initialed as to that label by all tally judges immediately under the word \"Defective\", and not counted, but placed in the envelope provided for that purpose labeled \"Defective Ballots Envelope\".

If however, because of the lack of adequate parking facilities at the central counting location or for some other reason, it is impossible or impracticable for the boxes from all the polling places to be delivered directly to the central counting location, the election official in charge of the election may designate some other location to which the boxes shall be delivered by the 2 precinct judges.  While at the other location the boxes shall be in the care and custody of one or more teams, each consisting of 4 persons, 2 from each of the 2 major political parties, designated for the purpose by the election official in charge of elections from recommendations by the appropriate political party organizations.  As soon as possible, the boxes shall be transported from the other location to the central counting location by one or more teams, each consisting of 4 persons, 2 from each of the 2 major political parties, designated for the purpose by the election official in charge of the election from recommendations by the appropriate political party organizations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or more teams of tally judges who possess the same qualifications as tally judges in election jurisdictions using paper ballots.  The number of the teams shall be determined by the election authority.  Each team shall consist of 5 tally judges, 3 selected and approved by the county board from a certified list furnished by the chair of the county central committee of the party with the majority of members on the county board and 2 selected and approved by the county board from a certified list furnished by the chair of the county central committee of the party with the second largest number of members on the county board.  At the central counting location  a team of tally judges shall open the ballot box and canvass the votes polled to determine that the number of ballot sheets therein agree with the number of voters voting as shown by the applications for ballot and, if the same do not agree, the tally judges shall make such ballots agree with the number of applications for ballot in the manner provided by Section 17-18 of this Code.  The tally judges shall then examine all ballot sheets that are in the ballot box to determine whether they bear the initials of the precinct judge of election.  If any ballot is not initialed, it shall be marked on the back \"Defective\", initialed as to that label by all tally judges immediately under the word \"Defective\", and not counted, but placed in the envelope provided for that purpose labeled \"Defective Ballots Envelope\".  An overvote for one office shall invalidate only the vote or count for that particular office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0judges designated by the election official in charge of the election shall deliver the ballot sheets to the technicians operating the automatic Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology tabulating equipment.  Any discrepancies between the number of ballots and total number of voters shall be noted on a sheet furnished for that purpose and signed by the tally judges.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24B-10.1)\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24B-10.1. In-precinct counting equipment; procedures for counting and\r\ntallying ballots.  In an election\r\njurisdiction where Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology\r\ncounting equipment is used, the following procedures for\r\ncounting and tallying the ballots shall apply:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the opening of the polls, and before the ballots are\r\nentered into the automatic tabulating equipment, the judges of\r\nelection shall be sure that the totals are all zeros in the\r\ncounting column.  Ballots may then be counted by entering or scanning\r\neach ballot into the automatic tabulating equipment.\r\nThroughout the election day and before the closing of the polls, no person\r\nmay check any vote totals for any candidate or proposition on the automatic\r\ntabulating equipment. Such automatic tabulating equipment shall be programmed\r\nso that no person may reset the equipment for refeeding of ballots unless\r\nprovided a code from an authorized representative of the election\r\nauthority.\r\nAt the option of the election authority, the ballots may be fed into the\r\nPrecinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology\r\nequipment by the voters under the direct\r\nsupervision of the judges of elections.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after the closing of the polls, the precinct judges of election shall open the ballot box\r\nand count the number of ballots to determine if the\r\nnumber agrees with the number of voters voting as shown on the\r\nPrecinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology equipment and by the\r\napplications for ballot or, if the same do not agree, the judges\r\nof election shall make the ballots agree with the applications\r\nfor ballot in the manner provided by Section 17-18 of this Code.\r\nThe judges of election shall then examine all ballots which are\r\nin the ballot box to determine whether the ballots contain the\r\ninitials of a precinct judge of election.  If any ballot is not\r\ninitialed, it shall be marked on the back \"Defective\", initialed\r\nas to such label by all judges immediately under the word\r\n\"Defective\" and not counted.  The judges of election shall place\r\nan initialed blank official ballot in the place of the defective\r\nballot, so that the count of the ballots to be counted\r\non the automatic tabulating equipment will be the same, and each\r\n\"Defective Ballot\" and \"Replacement\" ballot shall contain the\r\nsame serial number which shall be placed thereon by the judges of\r\nelection, beginning with number 1 and continuing consecutively\r\nfor the ballots of that kind in that precinct.  The original\r\n\"Defective\" ballot shall be placed in the \"Defective Ballot\r\nEnvelope\" provided for that purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the judges of election have removed a ballot pursuant to Section 17-18,\r\nhave labeled \"Defective\" a ballot which is not initialed, or have otherwise\r\ndetermined under this Code to not count a ballot originally deposited into a\r\nballot box, the judges of election shall be sure that the totals on the\r\nautomatic tabulating equipment are reset to all zeros in the counting column.\r\nThereafter the judges of election shall enter or otherwise scan each ballot\r\nto be counted in the\r\nautomatic tabulating equipment.  Resetting the automatic tabulating equipment\r\nto all zeros and re-entering of ballots to be counted may occur at the precinct\r\npolling place, the office of the election authority, or any receiving station\r\ndesignated by the election authority.  The election authority shall designate\r\nthe place for resetting and re-entering or re-scanning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology\r\nelectronic voting system is used which uses a paper ballot,\r\nthe judges of election shall examine the ballot for write-in\r\nvotes.  When the voter has cast a write-in vote, the judges of\r\nelection shall compare the write-in vote with the votes on the\r\nballot to determine whether the write-in results in an overvote\r\nfor any office, unless the Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan\r\nTechnology equipment has already done so.  In case of an overvote\r\nfor any office, the judges of election, consisting in each case\r\nof at least one judge of election of each of the 2 major\r\npolitical parties, shall make a true duplicate ballot of all\r\nvotes on such ballot except for the office which is\r\novervoted, by using the ballot of the precinct and one of the\r\nmarking devices, or equivalent ballot, of the precinct so as to transfer\r\nall votes\r\nof\r\nthe voter, except for the office overvoted, to a duplicate\r\nballot.  The original ballot upon which there is an overvote\r\nshall be clearly labeled \"Overvoted Ballot\", and each such\r\n\"Overvoted Ballot\" as well as its \"Replacement\" shall contain the\r\nsame serial number which shall be placed thereon by the judges of\r\nelection, beginning with number 1 and continuing consecutively\r\nfor the ballots of that kind in that precinct.  The \"Overvoted\r\nBallot\" shall be placed in an envelope provided for that purpose\r\nlabeled \"Duplicate Ballot\" envelope, and the judges of election\r\nshall initial the \"Replacement\" ballots and shall place them with\r\nthe other ballots to be counted on the automatic tabulating\r\nequipment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any ballot is damaged, defective, or if any ballot\r\notherwise contains a Voting Defect, so that it cannot properly be counted\r\nby the automatic tabulating equipment, the voter or the judges of\r\nelection, consisting in each case of at least one judge of\r\nelection of each of the 2 major political parties, shall make a\r\ntrue duplicate ballot of all votes on such ballot by using the\r\nballot of the precinct and one of the marking devices of the\r\nprecinct, or equivalent.  If a damaged ballot, the original ballot shall be\r\nclearly labeled \"Damaged Ballot\" and the ballot so produced shall\r\nbe clearly labeled \"Damaged Ballot\" and the ballot\r\nso produced shall be clearly labeled \"Duplicate Damaged Ballot\", and each\r\nshall contain the same serial number which shall be placed\r\nby the judges of election, beginning with number 1 and\r\ncontinuing consecutively for the ballots of that kind in the\r\nprecinct.  The judges of election shall initial the \"Duplicate\r\nDamaged Ballot\" ballot and shall enter or otherwise scan the duplicate\r\ndamaged\r\nballot into the automatic tabulating equipment.  The \"Damaged\r\nBallots\" shall be placed in the \"Duplicated Ballots\" envelope;\r\nafter all ballots have been successfully read, the judges of\r\nelection shall check to make certain that the Precinct Tabulation\r\nOptical Scan Technology equipment readout agrees with the number\r\nof voters making application for ballot in that precinct.  The\r\nnumber shall be listed on the \"Statement of Ballots\" form\r\nprovided by the election authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The totals for all candidates and propositions shall be tabulated. One  copy of an \"In-Precinct Totals Report\" shall be generated by the automatic tabulating equipment for return to the election authority. One copy of an \"In-Precinct Totals Report\" shall be generated and posted in a conspicuous place inside the polling place, provided that any authorized pollwatcher or other official authorized to be present in the polling place to observe the counting of ballots is present.\r\nThe judges of election shall\r\n provide, if requested, a copy\r\nfor each authorized pollwatcher or other official authorized to\r\nbe present in the polling place to observe the counting of\r\nballots.  In addition, sufficient time shall be\r\nprovided by the judges of election to the pollwatchers to allow\r\nthem to copy information from the copy which has been posted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judges of election shall count all unused ballots and\r\nenter the number on the \"Statement of Ballots\".  All \"Spoiled\",\r\n\"Defective\" and \"Duplicated\" ballots shall be counted and the\r\nnumber entered on the \"Statement of Ballots\".\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The precinct judges of election shall select a bi-partisan\r\nteam of 2 judges, who shall immediately return the ballots in a\r\nsealed container, along with all other election materials as\r\ninstructed by the election authority; provided, however, that\r\nsuch container must first be sealed by the election judges with\r\nfilament tape or other approved sealing devices provided for the\r\npurpose which shall be wrapped around the container lengthwise\r\nand crosswise, at least twice each way, in a manner that the\r\nballots cannot be removed from the container without breaking\r\nthe seal and filament tape and disturbing any signatures affixed\r\nby the election judges to the container, or which other approved\r\nsealing devices are affixed in a manner approved by the election\r\nauthority.  The election authority shall keep the office of the\r\nelection authority or any receiving stations designated by the\r\nauthority, open for at least 12 consecutive hours after the polls\r\nclose or until the ballots from all precincts with in-precinct\r\ncounting equipment within the jurisdiction of the election\r\nauthority have been returned to the election authority.  Ballots\r\nreturned to the office of the election authority which are not\r\nsigned and sealed as required by law shall not be accepted by the\r\nelection authority until the judges returning the ballots make and\r\nsign the necessary corrections.  Upon acceptance of the ballots\r\nby the election authority, the judges returning the ballots shall\r\ntake a receipt signed by the election authority and stamped with\r\nthe time and date of the return.  The election judges whose duty\r\nit is to return any ballots as provided shall, in the\r\nevent the ballots cannot be found when needed, on proper\r\nrequest, produce the receipt which they are to take as above\r\nprovided.  The precinct judges of election shall also deliver\r\nthe Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan Technology equipment to the\r\nelection authority.\n(Source: P.A. 102-819, eff. 5-13-22.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24B-11)\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24B-11.

As an additional part of this check prior to\r\nthe proclamation, in those jurisdictions where in-precinct\r\ncounting equipment is used, the election authority shall\r\nretabulate the total number of votes cast in 5% of the precincts\r\nwithin the election jurisdiction, as well as 5% of the voting devices used in early voting.  The precincts and the voting devices to be\r\nretabulated shall be selected after election day on a random\r\nbasis by the State Board of Elections, so that every precinct in the\r\nelection jurisdiction and every voting device used in early voting has an equal mathematical chance of being\r\nselected.  The State Board of Elections shall design a standard\r\nand scientific random method of selecting the precincts and voting devices which are\r\nto be retabulated.  The State central committee chair of each established political party\r\nshall be given prior written notice\r\nof the time and place of the random selection procedure and may\r\nbe represented at the procedure.  The retabulation shall\r\nconsist of counting the ballots which were originally counted and\r\nshall not involve any determination of which ballots were, in\r\nfact, properly counted.  The ballots from the precincts selected\r\nfor the retabulation shall remain at all times under the custody\r\nand control of the election authority and shall be transported\r\nand retabulated by the designated staff of the election\r\nauthority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As part of the retabulation, the election authority shall\r\ntest the computer program in the selected precincts and on the selected early voting devices.  The test\r\nshall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballots\r\nmarked to record a predetermined number of valid votes for\r\neach candidate and on each public question, and shall include for\r\neach office one or more ballots which have votes in excess of the\r\nnumber allowed by law to test the ability of the\r\nequipment and the marking device to reject such votes.

Testing of Direct Recording Electronic Voting\r\nSystem Equipment and Programs; Custody of Programs, Test\r\nMaterials and Ballots.  Prior to the public test, the election\r\nauthority shall conduct an errorless pre-test of the Direct\r\nRecording Electronic Voting System equipment and programs to\r\ndetermine that they will correctly detect voting defects and\r\ncount the votes cast for all offices and all public questions.\r\nOn any day not less than 5 days prior to the election day, the\r\nelection authority shall publicly test the Direct Recording\r\nElectronic Voting System equipment and programs to determine\r\nthat they will correctly detect voting errors and accurately\r\ncount the votes legally cast for all offices and on all public\r\nquestions.  Public notice of the time and place of the test\r\nshall be given at least 48 hours before the test by publishing\r\nthe notice in one or more newspapers within the election\r\njurisdiction of the election authority, if a newspaper is\r\npublished in that jurisdiction.  If a newspaper is not published\r\nin that jurisdiction, notice shall be published in a newspaper\r\nof general circulation in that jurisdiction.  Timely written\r\nnotice stating the date, time, and location of the public test\r\nshall also be provided to the State Board of Elections.  The\r\ntest shall be open to representatives of the political parties,\r\nthe press, representatives of the State Board of Elections, and\r\nthe public. The test shall be conducted by entering a pre-\r\naudited group of votes designed to record a predetermined number\r\nof valid votes for each candidate and on each public question,\r\nand shall include for each office one or more ballots having\r\nvotes exceeding the number allowed by law to test the ability of\r\nthe automatic tabulating equipment to reject the votes.  The\r\ntest shall also include producing an edit listing.  In those\r\nelection jurisdictions where in-precinct counting equipment is\r\nused, a public test of both the equipment and program shall be\r\nconducted as nearly as possible in the manner prescribed above.\r\nThe State Board of Elections may select as many election\r\njurisdictions as the Board deems advisable in the interests of\r\nthe election process of this State, to order a special test of\r\nthe automatic tabulating equipment and program before any\r\nregular election.  The Board may order a special test in any\r\nelection jurisdiction where, during the preceding 12 months,\r\ncomputer programming errors or other errors in the use of System\r\nresulted in vote tabulation errors.  Not less than 30 days\r\nbefore any election, the State Board of Elections shall provide\r\nwritten notice to those selected jurisdictions of their intent\r\nto conduct a test.  Within 5 days of receipt of the State Board\r\nof Elections' written notice of intent to conduct a test, the\r\nselected jurisdictions shall forward to the principal office of\r\nthe State Board of Elections a copy of all specimen ballots.\r\nThe State Board of Elections' tests shall be conducted and\r\ncompleted not less than 2 days before the public test and under the\r\nsupervision of the Board. The vendor, person, or other private entity shall be solely responsible for the production and cost of:  all ballots; additional temporary workers; and other equipment or facilities needed and used in the testing of the vendor's, person's, or other private entity's  respective equipment and software.  After an errorless test,\r\nmaterials used in the public test, including the program, if\r\nappropriate, shall be sealed and remain sealed until the test is\r\nrun again on election day.  If any error is detected, the cause\r\nof the error shall be determined and corrected, and an errorless\r\npublic test shall be made before the automatic tabulating\r\nequipment is approved.  Each election authority shall file a\r\nsealed copy of each tested program to be used within its\r\njurisdiction at an election with the State Board of Elections\r\nbefore the election.  The Board shall secure the program or\r\nprograms of each election jurisdiction so filed in its office\r\nuntil the next election of the same type (general primary, general election, consolidated primary, or consolidated election) for which the program or programs were filed.  At the expiration of that time, if no\r\nelection contest or appeal is pending in an election\r\njurisdiction, the Board shall destroy the sealed program or\r\nprograms.  Except\r\nwhere in-precinct counting equipment is used, the test shall be\r\nrepeated immediately before the start of the official counting\r\nof the ballots, in the same manner as set forth above.  After\r\nthe completion of the count, the test shall be re-run using the\r\nsame program.  Immediately after the re-run, all material used\r\nin testing the program and the programs shall be sealed and\r\nretained under the custody of the election authority for a\r\nperiod of 60 days.  At the expiration of that time the election\r\nauthority shall destroy the voted ballots, together with all\r\nunused ballots returned from the precincts.  Provided, if any\r\ncontest of election is pending at the time in which the ballots\r\nmay be required as evidence and the election authority has\r\nnotice of the contest, the same shall not be destroyed until\r\nafter the contest is finally determined.  If the use of back-up\r\nequipment becomes necessary, the same testing required for the\r\noriginal equipment shall be conducted.\n(Source: P.A. 93-574, eff. 8-21-03; 94-1000, eff. 7-3-06.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24C-10)\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24C-10. \n\nRecording of votes by Direct Recording\r\nElectronic Voting Systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whenever a Direct Recording Electronic Voting System is\r\nused to automatically record and count the votes on ballots, the\r\nprovisions of this Section shall apply.  A voter shall cast a\r\nproper vote on a ballot by marking the designated area for the\r\ncasting of a vote for any party or candidate or for or against\r\nany public question.  For this purpose, a mark is an intentional\r\nselection of the designated area on the ballot by appropriate\r\nmeans and which is not otherwise an identifying mark.\n(Source: P.A. 93-574, eff. 8-21-03.)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24C-11)\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24C-11.

A Direct Recording Electronic Voting System shall, in\r\naddition to satisfying the other requirements of this Article,\r\nfulfill the following functional requirements:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) Provide a voter in a primary election with the means\r\nof casting a ballot containing votes for any and all candidates\r\nof the party or parties of his or her choice, and for any and\r\nall non-partisan candidates and public questions and preclude\r\nthe voter from voting for any candidate of any other political\r\nparty except when legally permitted.  In a general election, the\r\nsystem shall provide the voter with means of selecting the\r\nappropriate number of candidates for any office, and of voting\r\non any public question on the ballot to which he or she is\r\nentitled to vote.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) If a voter is not entitled to vote for particular\r\ncandidates or public questions appearing on the ballot, the\r\nsystem shall prevent the selection of the prohibited votes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) Once the proper ballot has been selected, the\r\nsystem devices shall provide a means of enabling the recording\r\nof votes and the casting of said ballot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d) System voting devices shall provide voting choices\r\nthat are clear to the voter and labels indicating the names of\r\nevery candidate and the text of every public question on the\r\nvoter's ballot.  Each label shall identify the selection button\r\nor switch, or the active area of the ballot associated with it.\r\nThe system shall be able to incorporate minimal, easy-to-follow\r\non-screen instruction for the voter on how to cast a ballot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e) Voting devices shall (i) enable the voter to vote for\r\nany and all candidates and public questions appearing on the\r\nballot for which the voter is lawfully entitled to vote, in any\r\nlegal number and combination; (ii) detect and reject all votes\r\nfor an office or upon a public question when the voter has cast\r\nmore votes for the office or upon the public question than the\r\nvoter is entitled to cast; (iii) notify the voter if the voter's\r\nchoices as recorded on the ballot for an office or public\r\nquestion are fewer than or exceed the number that the voter is\r\nentitled to vote for on that office or public question and the\r\neffect of casting more or fewer votes than legally permitted; (iv) notify\r\nthe voter if the voter has failed to completely cast a vote for\r\nan office or public question appearing on the ballot; and (v)\r\npermit the voter, in a private and independent manner, to verify\r\nthe votes selected by the voter, to change the ballot or to\r\ncorrect any error on the ballot before the ballot is completely cast and\r\ncounted.  A means shall be provided to indicate each selection\r\nafter it has been made or canceled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f) System voting devices shall provide a means for the\r\nvoter to signify that the selection of candidates and public\r\nquestions has been completed.  Upon activation, the system shall\r\nrecord an image of the completed ballot, increment the proper\r\nballot position registers, and shall signify to the voter that\r\nthe ballot has been cast.  The system shall then prevent any\r\nfurther attempt to vote until it has been reset or re-enabled by\r\na judge of election.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(g) Each system voting device shall be equipped with a\r\npublic counter that can be set to zero prior to the opening of\r\nthe polling place, and that records the number of ballots cast\r\nat a particular election.  The counter shall be incremented only\r\nby the casting of a ballot.  The counter shall be designed to\r\nprevent disabling or resetting by other than authorized persons\r\nafter the polls close.  The counter shall be visible to all\r\njudges of election so long as the device is installed at the\r\npolling place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(h) Each system voting device shall be equipped with a\r\nprotective counter that records all of the testing and election\r\nballots cast since the unit was built.  This counter shall be\r\ndesigned so that its reading cannot be changed by any cause\r\nother than the casting of a ballot.  The protective counter\r\nshall be incapable of ever being reset and it shall be visible\r\nat all times when the device is configured for testing,\r\nmaintenance, or election use.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) All system devices shall provide a means of preventing\r\nfurther voting once the polling place has closed and after all\r\neligible voters have voted.  Such means of control shall\r\nincorporate a visible indication of system status.  Each device\r\nshall prevent any unauthorized use, prevent tampering with\r\nballot labels and preclude its re-opening once the poll closing\r\nhas been completed for that election.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(j) The system shall produce a printed summary report of\r\nthe votes cast upon each voting device.  Until the proper\r\nsequence of events associated with closing the polling place has\r\nbeen completed, the system shall not allow the printing of a\r\nreport or the extraction of data.  The printed report shall also\r\ncontain all system audit information to be required by the\r\nelection authority.  Data shall not be altered or otherwise\r\ndestroyed by report generation and the system shall ensure the\r\nintegrity and security of data for a period of at least 6 months\r\nafter the polls close.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(k) If more than one voting device is used in a polling\r\nplace, the system shall provide a means to manually or\r\nelectronically consolidate the data from all such units into a\r\nsingle report even if different voting systems are used to\r\nrecord ballots.  The system shall also be capable of\r\nmerging the vote tabulation results produced by other vote\r\ntabulation systems, if necessary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(l) System functions shall be implemented such that\r\nunauthorized access to them is prevented and the execution of\r\nauthorized functions in an improper sequence is precluded.\r\nSystem functions shall be executable only in the intended manner\r\nand order, and only under the intended conditions.  If the\r\npreconditions to a system function have not been met, the\r\nfunction shall be precluded from executing by the system's\r\ncontrol logic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(m) All system voting devices shall incorporate at least 3\r\nmemories in the machine itself and in its programmable memory\r\ndevices.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(n) The system shall include capabilities of recording and\r\nreporting the date and time of normal and abnormal events and of\r\nmaintaining a permanent record of audit information that cannot\r\nbe turned off.  Provisions shall be made to detect and record\r\nsignificant events (e.g., casting a ballot, error conditions\r\nthat cannot be disposed of by the system itself, time-dependent\r\nor programmed events that occur without the intervention of the\r\nvoter or a judge of election).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(o) The system and each system voting device must be\r\ncapable of creating, printing and maintaining a permanent paper\r\nrecord and an electronic image of each ballot that is cast such\r\nthat records of individual ballots are maintained by a subsystem\r\nindependent and distinct from the main vote detection,\r\ninterpretation, processing and reporting path.  The electronic\r\nimages of each ballot must protect the integrity of the data and\r\nthe anonymity of each voter, for example, by means of storage\r\nlocation scrambling.  The ballot image records may be either\r\nmachine-readable or manually transcribed, or both, at the\r\ndiscretion of the election authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) The system shall include built-in test, measurement\r\nand diagnostic software and hardware for detecting and reporting\r\nthe system's status and degree of operability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(q) The system shall contain provisions for maintaining\r\nthe integrity of memory voting and audit data during an election\r\nand for a period of at least 6 months thereafter and shall\r\nprovide the means for creating an audit trail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(r) The system shall be fully accessible so as to permit blind or\r\nvisually impaired voters as well as voters with physical disabilities \r\nto exercise their right to vote in private and without\r\nassistance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(s) The system shall provide alternative language\r\naccessibility if required pursuant to Section 203 of the Voting\r\nRights Act of 1965.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(t) Each voting device shall enable a voter to vote for a\r\nperson whose name does not appear on the ballot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(u) The system shall record and count accurately each vote\r\nproperly cast for or against any candidate and for or against\r\nany public question, including the names of all candidates whose\r\nnames are written in by the voters.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(v) The system shall allow for accepting provisional\r\nballots and for separating such provisional ballots from\r\nprecinct totals until authorized by the election authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(w) The system shall provide an effective audit trail as\r\ndefined in Section 24C-2 in this Code.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(x) The system shall be suitably designed for the purpose\r\nused, be durably constructed, and be designed for safety,\r\naccuracy and efficiency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(y) The system shall comply with all provisions of\r\nfederal, State and local election laws and regulations and any\r\nfuture modifications to those laws and regulations.\n(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15; 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(10 ILCS 5/24C-12)\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sec. 24C-12. Procedures for counting and tallying of\r\nballots. In an election jurisdiction where a Direct Recording\r\nElectronic Voting System is used, the following procedures for\r\ncounting and tallying the ballots shall apply:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the opening of the polls, the judges of elections\r\nshall assemble the voting equipment and devices and turn the\r\nequipment on.  The judges shall, if necessary, take steps to\r\nactivate the voting devices and counting equipment by inserting\r\ninto the equipment and voting devices appropriate data cards\r\ncontaining passwords and data codes that will select the proper\r\nballot formats selected for that polling place and that will\r\nprevent inadvertent or unauthorized activation of the poll-opening function.\r\nBefore voting begins and before ballots are\r\nentered into the voting devices, the judges of election shall\r\ncause to be printed a record of the following: the election's\r\nidentification data, the device's unit identification, the\r\nballot's format identification, the contents of each active\r\ncandidate register by office and of each active public question\r\nregister showing that they contain all zero votes, all ballot\r\nfields that can be used to invoke special voting options, and\r\nother information needed to ensure the readiness of the\r\nequipment and to accommodate administrative reporting\r\nrequirements.  The judges must also check to be sure that the\r\ntotals are all zeros in the counting columns and in the public\r\ncounter affixed to the voting devices.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the judges have determined that a person is qualified\r\nto vote, a voting device with the proper ballot to which the\r\nvoter is entitled shall be enabled to be used by the voter.  The\r\nballot may then be cast by the voter by marking by appropriate\r\nmeans the designated area of the ballot for the casting of a\r\nvote for any candidate or for or against any public question.\r\nThe voter shall be able to vote for any and all candidates and\r\npublic measures appearing on the ballot in any legal number and\r\ncombination and the voter shall be able to delete, change or\r\ncorrect his or her selections before the ballot is cast.  The\r\nvoter shall be able to select candidates whose names do not\r\nappear upon the ballot for any office by entering electronically\r\nas many names of candidates as the voter is entitled to select\r\nfor each office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Upon completing his or her selection of candidates or\r\npublic questions, the voter shall signify that voting has been\r\ncompleted by activating the appropriate button, switch or active\r\narea of the ballot screen associated with end of voting.  Upon\r\nactivation, the voting system shall record an image of the\r\ncompleted ballot, increment the proper ballot position\r\nregisters, and shall signify to the voter that the ballot has\r\nbeen cast.  Upon activation, the voting system shall also print\r\na permanent paper record of each ballot cast as defined in\r\nSection 24C-2 of this Code.  This permanent paper record shall\r\n(i) be printed in a clear, readily readable format that can be easily reviewed by the voter for completeness and accuracy and (ii) either be self-contained within the voting device or be\r\ndeposited by the voter into a secure ballot box.  No permanent\r\npaper record shall be removed from the polling place except by\r\nelection officials as authorized by this Article.  All permanent\r\npaper records shall be preserved and secured by election\r\nofficials in the same manner as paper ballots and shall be\r\navailable as an official record for any recount, redundant\r\ncount, or verification or retabulation of the vote count\r\nconducted with respect to any election in which the voting\r\nsystem is used.
